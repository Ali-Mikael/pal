- Creating states for configuration management system **Salt**. More about salt here: <https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/about_salt_project.html#about-salt>
- Create modules under `/srv/salt/` .
- For example = `/srv/salt/<your-module>`
- Inside the module (directory) you create a file init.sls, which will serve as an entry point for further configurations when running the module.
- Now you can run it with the command `$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply <moduleName>`, and it will start executing the init.sls file.
- When running the command, we get a detailed output of what happened, what actions were taken and what was the result.
- It's good practice to check that it actually worked by using a different tool than the one we used originally. Meaning the Salt configuration management system.
- Notes:
  - `Changed = 1` in the output means that Salt changed/created something.
  - `Succeeded = 1` means that nothing new happened, and that the setting we wanted to apply, were already present on the system.
  - Further runs of the same idempotent state/command will return `Succeeded = 1`.

**YAML**
- > Reference: <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/en/latest/topics/overview.html#rules-of-yaml>
- The Salt config files are typed in YAML, and the YAML renderer (as default) compiles it into Python data structures.
- Basics for creating YAML:
  - `key: value` pairs. Colon after key and a space before value. 
  - All keys are case-sensitive.
  - No tabs, only spaces!
- YAML structure
  - Three basic element types:
  - Scalars =  `key: value` mappings. Value can be string, number or a boolean.
  - Lists = a `key` followed by a list of values on their own lines. New line, two spaces, a hyphen and a space followed by the value.
  - Dictionaries = a collection of the above mentioned types.
