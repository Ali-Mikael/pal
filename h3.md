- Creating states for configuration management system **Salt**. More about Salt here: <https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/about_salt_project.html#about-salt>
- Create modules under the `/srv/salt/` structure.
- For example = `/srv/salt/<your-module>`
- Inside the module (directory) you create a file `init.sls`, which will serve as an entry point for configurations when running the module. It's the first file to be read in the directory.
- Now you can run it with the command `$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply <moduleName>`, and it will start executing the init.sls file from the specified directory.
- When running the command we get a detailed output of what happened, what actions were taken and what was the result.
- It's good practice to check that it actually worked by using a different tool than the one we used originally.
- Notes:
  - `Changed = 1` in the output means that Salt changed/created something.
  - `Succeeded = 1` means that nothing new happened, and that the settings we wanted to apply, were already present on the system.
  - By further applying the same state over and over again, and always returning `Succeeded = 1` means that the configurations being applied are idempotent. 

**YAML**
- > Reference: <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/en/latest/topics/overview.html#rules-of-yaml>
- The Salt config files are typed in YAML, and the (default) YAML renderer compiles it into Python data structures.
- **Basics for creating YAML:**
  - `key: value` pairs. Colon after key and a space before value. 
  - All `keys` are case-sensitive.
  - No tabs, only spaces!
- **YAML structure**
  - Three basic element types:
  - *Scalars* =  `key: value` mappings. Value can be string, number or a boolean.
  - *Lists* = a `key` followed by a list of values on their own respective lines = New line, two spaces indentation, a hyphen (-) and a space followed by the `value`.
  - *Dictionaries* = a collection of the above mentioned elements, meaning `key:` followed by either a value or list.
  - For example
    - ``` 
      Truck: Volvo
      Excavator: CAT
      Cars:
        - BMW
        - Mercedes
        - Ferrari
      ```
