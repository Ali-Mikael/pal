# Summary - X

### Infa-as-code - X
> Reference: <https://terokarvinen.com/2024/hello-salt-infra-as-code/>

- Creating states for configuration management system **Salt**. More about Salt here: <https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/about_salt_project.html#about-salt>
- Create modules under the `/srv/salt/` structure.
- For example = `/srv/salt/<your-module>`
- Inside the module (directory) you create a file `init.sls`, which will serve as an entry point for configurations when running the module. It's the first file to be read in the directory.
- Now you can run it locally on the minion with the command `$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply <moduleName>`, and it will start executing the init.sls.
- When running the command we get a detailed output of what happened, what actions were taken and what was the result.
- It's good practice to check that it actually worked by using a different tool than the one we used originally.
- Notes:
  - `Changed=1` in the output means that Salt changed/created something.
  - `Succeeded: 1` means that nothing new happened, and that the settings we wanted to apply, were already present on the system.
  - By further applying the same state over and over again, and always returning the `Succeeded: 1` without the `Changed=1` ", means that the .sls file is idempotent. 

### YAML - X 
> Reference: <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/en/latest/topics/overview.html#rules-of-yaml>


- The Salt config files are typed in YAML, and the (default) YAML renderer compiles it into Python data structures.
- **Basics for creating YAML:**
  - `key: value` pairs. Colon after key and a space before value. 
  - All `keys` are case-sensitive.
  - No tabs, only spaces!
- **YAML structure**
  - Three basic element types:
  - *Scalars* =  `key: value` mappings. Value can be string, number or a boolean.
  - *Lists* = a `key` followed by a list of values on their own respective lines = New line, two spaces indentation, a hyphen (-) and a space followed by the `value`.
  - *Dictionaries* = A collection of the above mentioned elements, meaning `key:` followed by either a value or list.
  - For example
    - ```
      Box1: Shirts
      Box2: Jeans
      Box3:
        - Socks
        - Boxers
        - Hats
      ```

### Setting up the minion
- Vagrant is goated in getting a minion quickly up and running. This is the Vagrantfile I used:
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 12 57 43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e24928db-23e4-4b4d-9600-ce1901dd13fd)
- Created the machine with `$ vagrant up` and log into it with `$ vagrant ssh`
- Making sure él minion is up, running and functional with `$ sudo systemctl status salt-minon` 
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 01 11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db9a2ccb-b1a2-4701-b845-4d1e2d38e190)



### The init.sls inside the module
- First things first: `$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt` && `$ cd /srv/salt` (create the Salt directory to store  module and then move into it. (the /srv directory is used to store data for servers))
- Creating the module/directory `$ sudo mkdir example-module` and moving into it.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 15 34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74b7aa2a-7f94-444d-b08b-012ef36c5f16)
- Creating the config file:
  - `$ sudo nano init.sls`
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 30 15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3e8142f-d744-4058-bc7f-6f3f6c2c91c1)
    - Pretty simple stuff. The `init.sls` will trigger the `file.managed` function to check for a file called `emptyfile.txt` in the `/tmp` directory. And if not present, create it.
- Running the module with `$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply example-module`
- Result:
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 33 03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39af74a6-c17c-4bad-a641-3783927b1df7)
  - We can se the operation was successful from the `Changes` section with the comment:
    - `new: file /tmp/emptyfile.txt created`
    - Making sure it actually worked, using something else than Salt. 
    - >>> `$ ls /tmp/emptyfile.txt`

# Master says - C/D

### Setting up a master - minion relationship
- Easily setup one master and two minions with Vagrant using the following Vagrant config file: 
  - <img width="1090" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 19 35 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5effb09-474a-4fbd-8d32-40f74748a64f" />
  - <img width="941" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 19 35 43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99553090-24b5-4719-80fe-b1eada6cb694" />
- Validating the file before booting up with `$ vagrant validate`
  - <img width="872" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 18 01 34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22398e6e-f472-4b06-bd23-141efd375854" />
- Once the VM's were up, I logged into the master with `$ vagrant ssh master`
 
**First line of business** 
- Establishing the relationship between the master and the slaves by accepting their keys, and then confirming connection. 
  - <img width="632" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 18 07 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4407abf-cc02-4173-bc47-779d5f47458a" />
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 15 17 20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96856c01-d0db-43dc-a4ca-f97285ae6ced)

### One module feeds many slaves
- We need the root directory for Salt to check for configurations, and at the same time, we want to create a directory for our own module.
- Easy: `$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/module1`. This command creates the required root `/srv/salt` (if it doesn't already exist) and sets up the base directory for our first module.
- `$ sudo nano init.sls` will create the default file that will be ran when we call our module. 
- The init file in this example will lead to the creation of a file called "emptyfile.txt" in the `/tmp` directory, if it doesn't already exist, on all minions. 
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 15 20 59](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0b0a850-3b3b-4eb1-a914-c0014c41f9fc)

While I was on it, I created two more state files within the module.
- One would cause Salt to add text to our newly created file.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 15 29 23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee66a5f8-5aba-4e1d-831b-f9dda4e236a2)
- The other would check if specific packages are installed, and if not, well u know, install them! :D
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 15 32 27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa62a462-fa25-4e14-b5fb-71647410dcca)
- Let's try out our init.file by running the module with `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply module1`
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 15 45 25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c743aec-a187-4359-975e-83d5e5a1488e)
  - We can see that the state in init.sls was applied correctly, as Salt had now created a file in the `/tmp` directory.
  - 2 things giving us reassurance from the output:
    - `Changes: new: file /tmp/emptyfile.txt created`
    - `Succeeded 1 (changed=1)`
- Now let's see what happens when we run it again
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 15 50 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e148d2-03e6-4e71-a251-0f1ad988d782)
  - Upon running the same command again, and this time getting:
    - `Comment: File /tmp/emptyfile.txt exists with proper permissions. No changes made.`
    - And `Succeeded: 1` (call to mind that this means no changes were made as the state was already active)
    - We can make an educated guess and say that our init.sls file is idempotent!
  - **Double checking**
    - `$ exit` - Exiting our master
    - `$ vagrant ssh minion01` - Accessing our slave locally
    - `$ ls /tmp/emptyfile.txt` & `$ cat /tmp/emptyfile.txt` - Making sure the file is present and that it is empty. 
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 00 34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c52d603e-63ef-4d79-bebb-41238a27cd57)
    - An absolute success! Let's go back to our master and try out our next state.
- **-Back on the master-**
  - Let's quickly check what state files we can use:
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 06 11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/113ba910-3d4a-4c68-9534-0449d4ba4dc9)
- Lets's add some text to the empty file!
  - `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply module1.addtext` (because init.sls is the default file when calling the module, we have to specify which state to apply with `module1.filename`)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 08 27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4404611b-65ff-4baa-a53a-767b82daff5c)
  - By using the function `file.append` we succesfully instructed Salt to append some text to the file we created earlier. (duplicate output retracted, just take my word for it that it worked on both minions).
  - If the file "emptyfile.txt" would not have existed, Salt would've created it first, and then appended the line.
  - **Idempotency?**
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 15 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c2fcb07-fe19-4d1a-8a9b-343784e11d68)
  - **Q:** How do we know it's idempotent?
  - **A:** Clue number **#1** = the comment already tells us that "file is in correct state", and clue number **#2**, we make the observation, that this time around we have no `changed=1`, but only the `Succeeded: 1`.
  - These are good indicators on the matter. But ofcourse we want to be 100% certain. So let's navigate back to our minion again and take a look for ourselves:
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 16 56](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0210129c-e3c0-4560-8221-de6b9e5b260d)
    - Success!
  ### Installing packages
  - `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply module1.tools`
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 37 25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e193ab-c48d-4861-b532-a4eac4fd5869)
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 37 52](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f236ea0b-92ec-4b25-abb1-4da41a4cc2cf)
    - We can see that `tmux` was already installed, but `apache` and `tree` were yet to be downloaded (or updated), so salt went ahead and downloaded/updated them on the target systems. 
  - Running it again to make sure of idempotency:
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 16 38 18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dd45859-ab02-4b63-99fb-a8cfab1bd992)
  - **Note:**
    - `Comment: All specified packages are already installed`
    - `Succeede: 1` 
  - And then finally getting peace of mind by confirming success locally on the minion:
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 17 05 30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c641578-5a2b-4dbf-bc7e-457dad5fb690)

### One file to rule them all?
- All the states we've been applying, could've been specified in the `init.sls` and then applied in one go. The way that it was done here was for educational purposes. It's easier to follow along and understand what's going on when you do it step by step innit. 
- Now we're going to make things **super easy** for us. Let us create one single file, and then apply all the states to all our minions with one command: `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply module1`
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 17 06 28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ddd5707-c7ee-44e6-aa18-6046f752cf0f)
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 17 07 24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3581257-b27e-43ab-ac14-24365f28c990)
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 17 07 45](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3046e9c-6ed9-4bc0-8f02-0a40fb573fbb)
  - **Q:** Is the init.sls file still idempotent?
  - **A:** Very much so, thank you for asking! 🙏
    - Running the module a second time:
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 17 08 30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f543421f-5174-44b8-9a0b-4dd945b2ba59)
