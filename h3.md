- Creating states for configuration management system **Salt**. More about Salt here: <https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/about_salt_project.html#about-salt>
- Create modules under the `/srv/salt/` structure.
- For example = `/srv/salt/<your-module>`
- Inside the module (directory) you create a file `init.sls`, which will serve as an entry point for configurations when running the module. It's the first file to be read in the directory.
- Now you can run it with the command `$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply <moduleName>`, and it will start executing the init.sls file from the specified directory.
- When running the command we get a detailed output of what happened, what actions were taken and what was the result.
- It's good practice to check that it actually worked by using a different tool than the one we used originally.
- Notes:
  - `Changed = 1` in the output means that Salt changed/created something.
  - `Succeeded = 1` means that nothing new happened, and that the settings we wanted to apply, were already present on the system.
  - By further applying the same state over and over again, and always returning `Succeeded = 1` means that the state being applied is idempotent. 

**YAML**
- > Reference: <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/en/latest/topics/overview.html#rules-of-yaml>
- The Salt config files are typed in YAML, and the (default) YAML renderer compiles it into Python data structures.
- **Basics for creating YAML:**
  - `key: value` pairs. Colon after key and a space before value. 
  - All `keys` are case-sensitive.
  - No tabs, only spaces!
- **YAML structure**
  - Three basic element types:
  - *Scalars* =  `key: value` mappings. Value can be string, number or a boolean.
  - *Lists* = a `key` followed by a list of values on their own respective lines = New line, two spaces indentation, a hyphen (-) and a space followed by the `value`.
  - *Dictionaries* = A collection of the above mentioned elements, meaning `key:` followed by either a value or list.
  - For example
    - ``` 
      Box1: Shirts
      Box2: Jeans
      Box3:
        - Socks
        - Boxers
        - Hats
      ```

**Setting up my minion**
- Vagrantfile for my machine:

- Created the machine with `$ vagrant up` and logged into it with `$ vagrant ssh`
- Making sure my minion is up and running properly with `$ sudo systemctl status salt-minon` 
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 01 11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db9a2ccb-b1a2-4701-b845-4d1e2d38e190)



**Lets's create a salt state then shall we**
- First things first: `$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt` && `$ cd /srv/salt` (create the salt directory to store our modules, and then move into it. (the /srv directory is used to store data for servers)
- Then I created my first module by creating a directory `$ sudo mkdir example-module` and moving into it.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 15 34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74b7aa2a-7f94-444d-b08b-012ef36c5f16)
- Time for the config file:
  - `$ sudo nano init.sls`
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 30 15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3e8142f-d744-4058-bc7f-6f3f6c2c91c1)
    - Pretty simple stuff. The `init.sls` will trigger the file state function to check for a file called `emptyfile.txt` in the `/tmp` directory. And if not present, create it.
- Running the module with `$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply example-module`
- Result:
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-13 at 13 33 03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39af74a6-c17c-4bad-a641-3783927b1df7)
  - We can se the operation was successful from the `Changes` section with the comment:
    - `new: file /tmp/emptyfile.txt created`
    - Still making sure it actually worked with `$ ls /tmp/emptyfile.txt`
