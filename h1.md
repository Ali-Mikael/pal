## Running salt command locally
> Reference: <https://terokarvinen.com/2021/salt-run-command-locally/>

**Salt functions**
- Salt is normally used to control slave-computers over a network.
- It can be downloaded using: `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install salt-minion -y` (installing the salt slave)
- The five most important state functions:
  - **PKG**
    - Ensures that a package is installed - `pkg.installed`
  - **File**
    - Manages files - `file.managed`
  - **Service**
    - Is a service running and enabled? - `service.running`
  - **User**
    - Is there a user with specific attributes? - `user.present`
  - **CMD**
    - Running commands - `cmd.run`
<br>



## Installing salt
> Reference: <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/install-by-operating-system/linux-deb.html>

**How to install salt for Debian**
- Installing the Salt Project repository:
  - `$ mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings` (making sure the keyrings dir exists)
  - `$ curl -fsSL https://packages.broadcom.com/artifactory/api/security/keypair/SaltProjectKey/public | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/salt-archive-keyring.pgp` (downloading public key)
  - `$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/saltstack/salt-install-guide/releases/latest/download/salt.sources | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/salt.sources` (creating apt repository target configuration)
- `$ sudo apt update` to update the metadata
- Now you can install minion, master or other Salt components!
- When the wanted components are installed, go ahead and activate them with: `$ sudo systemctl enable xx && sudo systemctl start xx`
<br>


## The master and the slave
> Reference: <https://terokarvinen.com/2018/03/28/salt-quickstart-salt-stack-master-and-slave-on-ubuntu-linux/> 

We already know that Salt can be used to control slave-computers over a network. 
Now, we're gonna briefly look into the installation process. 
<br>

**Installing the master**
- `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install salt-master -y`
- get the masters hostname with: `$ hostname -I`
<br>

**Making the slaves obedient**
- On the slave, edit the minion (slave) file `$ /etc/salt/minion`
- Type in the master hostname and ID for the slave (ID must be unique).
- To be able to connect to the master restart the slave daemon: `$ sudo systemctl restart salt-minion.service`
- Then back on the master, accept the slave key: `$ sudo salt-key -A`
- Now you can make the slave follow commands. Try it out first with: `$ sudo salt '*' cmd.run 'whoami'`.
  - Did you get a reply?
  -  if answer = yes: print("it's working")
  -  else: print("try again")




## How to write a technical report 101 
> Reference: <https://terokarvinen.com/2006/06/04/raportin-kirjoittaminen-4/>

**Things to keep in mind**
- Write down everything you do in detail!
  - How you did it.
  - What kind of environment you did it in.
  - And everything that happened as a consequence.
  - Best practise is to write down as you go!
- Always remember to be spesific and thorough when reporting problems & unexpected outcomes/behavior.
- How did you fix them, or were you able to fixe them at all? Do tell!
- Format the report properly so that it is easy to read and follow along.
- Always remember to include your references and sources!



# Salt-minion (B)
> References: <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/install-by-operating-system/linux-deb.html>

- I had a Linux machine running with Debian12 on my laptop, so I started the process by first downloading the Salt-project public key with the command seen in the picture:
  - <img width="1111" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 23 54 03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b31fe9d9-2679-436f-b695-f802077030ee" />
  
- I then made sure that it exists:
  - <img width="568" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 23 56 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ca98b8c-45e9-4829-9c9f-53d4efe25ff5" />
  - There was a typo in the name, so I used `sudo mv salt-arhive-keyring.pgp salt-archive.keyring.pgp` to take care of the problem.

- It was time to download the repository.
  - <img width="1116" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 0 01 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17d67506-405f-483b-965a-b125e8e6702e" />
  
- After a successful installation I updated the metadata with `$ sudo apt update`
  - <img width="1272" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 0 10 06" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5226d6a7-998e-4dee-b5bb-334062d979c9" />

- Now I could just simply download the salt-minion with: `sudo apt install salt-minion`
  - <img width="1268" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 0 28 29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/842b641f-d9ae-41d5-a990-215c365bf3ad" />

# The crucial five (C-D)
> References: <https://terokarvinen.com/2021/salt-run-command-locally/>

### 1 - PKG
- Running the command `$ sudo salt-call --local -l info state.single pkg.installed tmux` will check if the package is installed (in this case tmux), and if not already present, install it. This is a good example of how idempotency works. As running this command more than one time will always produce the same result.
  - <img width="1271" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 0 40 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/669f5e4a-4637-441e-8292-0ecfad983c70" />
  - The line "Comment: All specified packages are already installed" indeed confirms that tmux is already installed

### 2 - File
- The `$ sudo salt-call --local -l info state.single file.managed` + `filepath` will check if the file exist. If not, it will create the file. If you append to the command + `contents="xyz"`, if will check for the file and if the specified content exists. If the file exists, but the content doesn't match, it will overwrite the file with the content you specified.
- <img width="1270" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 1 24 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14f6fe8f-46ca-4011-8cc5-486e85f82622" />
- <img width="1268" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 1 24 23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d13b7e-5adf-4a8d-8baa-73396f29134c" />

### 3 - Daemons
- Check to see if the SSH server is enabled, up and running & booted at startup with the command:
- `$ sudo salt-call --local state.single service.running sshd enable=True`
  - <img width="1253" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 14 34 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b975d76-74e3-4778-b176-9411c78e6548" />
- From the "result = true" we can see that sshd is enabled at bootup, and the comment "Service sshd is running", confirms for us that it is in fact up and running at the moment of giving the command.


### 4 - User
- The command `$ sudo salt-call --local -l info state.single user.present` will check for users, and if it not present, will create one for us.
- Here we can see the result when using the command with the main user, it will just confirm that the user is up to date and present:
  - <img width="1264" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 14 37 16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73985532-9faa-44cd-98db-101fd36c6175" />
- How about when it doesn't exist?
  - <img width="1271" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 14 36 34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60d20318-6024-4c4f-b259-d3d41c0f680e" />
  - It returns true once again, but this time it was created from scratch, as we can see from the output in the comment section "New user xxx created"
  - Confirmation:
  - <img width="809" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 14 38 01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6081406-99a1-4d10-b622-16e288660fbf" />


### 5 - CMD
- Let's take an example of running a command locally on a salt-minion.
  - `$ sudo salt-call --local -l info state.single cmd.run 'touch /home/alig/playingGround' creates="/home/alig/playingGround"` 
  - <img width="1271" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 14 53 20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37546ebb-3c9f-4034-89d7-47143e5924e0" />
  - Without the argument `creates`, it will just overwrite an existing file/directory, so initself the command is not idempotent. But with the argument `creates` and the variable, it will only create it if the variable is false. So in this case because we already have a directory called playingGround (=true), it will not try to create it again and overwrite the whole thing. We achieved idempotency in this case!
  - Next example:
  - <img width="1272" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 14 54 32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14e0a641-59ca-497c-a515-c6759c01cfff" />
  - By specifying a file/directory that doesn't exist, in this case `creates="/home/alig/thisfiledoesntexist"` it will execute our command, and create an empty file in our home directory.
  - NOTE: Because the command and `creates` have different files tied to them, this command is not idempotent!
  - Confirmation:
  - <img width="411" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 14 55 19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e68c7101-3c39-4c81-8324-664ef24095dc" />

  - **WARNING:** in this example I used a variable that will always be false unless i go manually creating the file now. You shouldn't use different arguments/files/filepaths/variables within the command like shown here. Always use the same specs for the command and the `creates` variable. (I just wanted to prove something here innit, let's just say it was for educational purposes)
