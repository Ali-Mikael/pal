A quick guide to setup a two computer virtual network in minutes
- Install vagrant with: `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install vagrant virtualbox`
- Saving your **vagrantfile** in a new directory: `$ mkdir thedirectory` and then inside the directory `$ nano Vagrantfile`
- Template for the config file can be found @ the link above.
- After you have the machines up and running, you can log in to them via SSH: `$ vagrant ssh <name>`
- **Perks:** very easy to destroy `$ vagrant destroy` & super simple to get machines up and running again `$ vagrant up`
