A quick guide to setup a two computer virtual network in minutes
- Install vagrant with: `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install vagrant virtualbox`
- Saving your **vagrantfile** in a new directory: `$ mkdir thedirectory` and then inside the directory `$ nano Vagrantfile`
- Template for the config file can be found @ the link above.
- After you have the machines up and running, you can log in to them via SSH: `$ vagrant ssh <name>`
- **Perks:** very easy to destroy `$ vagrant destroy` & super simple to get machines up and running again `$ vagrant up`

## Salt Vagrant - X
> Reference:
> - <https://terokarvinen.com/2023/salt-vagrant/#infra-as-code---your-wishes-as-a-text-file>
> - <https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/en/latest/topics/states.html#organizing-states>
> - <https://medium.com/@mickeyschwarz789/the-basics-of-salt-822a12909892>

**An example of applying a state:**
- Create the desired path: `$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/hello`.
- `/srv/salt` is the default root where salt looks for state files. In this case "hello" is the new state we're going to configure.
- Create the Salt State File A.K.A **.sls**: `$ sudoedit /srv/salt/hello/init.sls`.
- The .sls like all file extensions in Linux is only for the end user to differentiate more easily between files. 
- Contents of the `init.sls` file (written YAML):
- ```
  $ /tmp/infra-as-code:
      file.managed
  ```
- Now you can apply this to all minions simply with: `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply hello`.
- **Q: But what does it do?**
  - A: You basically apply the `hello` state (which you created and configured yourself), on all minions (by using the wild card = *), to check if they have the file `/tmp/infra-as-code`, and in case it isn't present, well you know, create it (an empty file named infra-as-code)!
<br>

**top.sls**
- The top.sls helps with scaling, as you can easily specify which states to run on which minions, without having to manually type everything out on the commandline.
- `/srv/salt/top.sls`
- contents of our top.sls in this example:
- ```
  base:
    '*':
      -hello
  ````
- `base` is the default environment to use as the root.
- `'*'` means all the minions. Here you could specify which minions in particular with the minion ID.
- `-hello` tells salt to apply the hello state.  
- Now you don't have to specify which modules to run. You simply type `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply`, and it will automatically run the hello state (in this case) on all your minions at the same time.

**Setting up**
- The first step was to install Vagrant. (I already had VirtualBox, which is used for the virtualization)
- I used commands
- `$ brew tap hashicorp/tap` (this adds the repo to known repositories for brew to install and update from) (brew is a package manager for MacOS)
  - <img width="551" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 12 33 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbf62a6c-8a35-4786-a044-60e93de76bb1" />
- `$ brew install hashicorp/tap/hashicorp-vagrant` (this installs vagrant)
  - <img width="1133" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 12 36 57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d5015f-3ec5-4def-b380-25ad74570917" />
- `$ vagrant init` is the command to produce a Vagrantfile which will work as the basic configuration file for your VM/VM's.
  - <img width="854" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 12 38 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22a4ba95-edfc-4da0-93cc-f1887c2585d2" />
- I then searched for compatible base images A.K.A boxes to use for the VM in the vagrant cloud @ <https://vagrantcloud.com/search>
- Specified parameters **"Provider: Virtualbox"** & **"Architecture: arm64"** to cater to my needs.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 20 28 26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab99f014-703b-4124-b66f-48776b0d5010)
- I scrolled down the page until I found a `bento/` box for Ubuntu which I thought would suit me just fine.
- <https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/bento/ubuntu-24.04>
- **Q:** Why bento? **A:** Because Vagrant officially recommended them on their website. Read: <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/boxes> for more!
- **Q:** Okay but why Ubuntu? **A:** At this point in time, just a question of preference honestly.
- After I located a proper box, I went ahead and added it on Vagrant with the command `$ vagrant box add bento/ubuntu-24.04`.
- Vagrant then asked me whitch provider to use, so I obviously chose VirtalBox!
- And then with the command `$ vagrant box list` I made sure of two things:
  - 1) It was added properly.
  - 2) It was the image with the correct architecture. (arm64 in my case)
  - <img width="1303" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 21 39 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e7587c-4b7d-4534-a93d-66f0b57e9576" />
- Now I could configure Vagrantfile:
  - <img width="1304" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 22 15 48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81cb42fa-3f98-46d8-8a48-b0239bcf8c29" />
- `$ vagrant ssh` will connect to your new VM!
  - <img width="1224" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 21 45 04" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ec37e10-1f1c-4919-8217-df52fa01f2c9" />
  - <img width="1059" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 21 46 11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8505419-0ca8-420a-b121-37bdf41026ef" />
- Everything worked fine, so this test run was conlcuded as a success!
- **Terminating Playground-protocol:**
  - <img width="1025" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 21 46 48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00258de8-c5b9-4594-9600-9e94de0261a9" />

So I decided to kill two birds with one stone, and set up a three computer virtual network with two slaves and one master. For this I used Vagrant in conjunction with Salt. Interesting stuff indeed, let's dive right in!

**Setting up**
- <img width="861" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 23 22 21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb769ce0-5da6-4a48-ba4d-3a2dc6a63f5a" />
- By creating a new directory within my Vagrant directory called `VirtualNetwork` and moving into it, I could place a new Vagrantfile there with `$ vagrant init`, and vagrant would use it as the primary config file as long as I was situated in that directory. 


**Road to success**
- I already knew the basics of Vagrant, so now it was time to level up. I made pretty heavy adjustments to the configuration file.
  - <img width="1366" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 2 50 36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60e4db76-3b80-498d-8028-16cbd5fd375b" />
  - <img width="1366" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 2 51 06" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364326fe-325f-4485-8b31-aff401708580" />

- Let's dissect the configurations that took place:
- The first script `$tscript` (that would run on all VM'S) would do the groundwork for installing salt. Check <https://ali-mikael.github.io/pal/h1> / "Installing Salt" for more.
- The `set -o verbose` at the beginning of the file was simply there for debugging purposes.
- The `$minion` script, as the name suggests would install salt-minion. It would then configure the masters IP, minion hostname, and then reload the service so that the new configurations would take place.
- `$master` pretty self explanatory at this point.
  - **Note:** I missed something pretty big here as I was making the configurations late at night. We'll go through the mistake later on in this chapter when it emerges, and also how to fix it!
- The second part of the file specifies which machines to create (and hostnames for them), what base to use, which scripts to apply and additionally some IP-addressing.


**Vagrant UP**
- After a few minutes of letting the scripts work their magic. I had succesfully created 3 virtual machines in 1 go.
- I first tried out the minion#2
  - Logging in with `$ vagrant ssh t002` 
  - I then made sure the script worked expectedly, and moved straight up into the /etc/salt directory to check the minion configurations.
  - <img width="654" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 03 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b02141-08fe-499b-86a3-80bb471a21e4" />
  - Success!
- The next logical step was to see if t001 was also up und running by pinging the IP-address we configured for it
  - <img width="862" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 01 13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4093ea6b-ae25-40b7-8bff-3023c61115c1" />
  - This also seemed to be a huge success. The machines were up and running and the connection was there.
- Now that I knew my slaves were working, time to log into the master
  - <img width="1189" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 2 58 55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b40737c3-99dd-4576-b57b-543b3804269b" />
- The idea was to accept the Minion-keys straight up. But here was the problem I mentioned before. Because I forgot to configure the service (salt-master) to enable and start after installation, the minions couldn't connect to it.
  - <img width="1292" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 08 54" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23eb5fd0-deac-4ad5-88a5-5e19155569d2" />
  - `$ sudo salt-key -L` should list the keys, but I didn't see any, which initially sparked my worry.
  - When I tried the connection from my master to the slaves with `$ sudo salt '*' test.ping` it didn't connect, but atleast I got some useful output: "The salt master could not be contacted. Is master running?"
  - I quickly enabled and started the service with `$ sudo systemctl enable salt-master && sudo systemctl start salt-master` and then used the command `$ sudo salt-key -L` again to confirm if my actions had corrected the situation, which they had, as seen in the output above. Now I could just accept the keys with `$ sudo salt-key -A` 
  - <img width="776" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 09 34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8f57fb2-8681-4e3d-bf16-3b85cb6b2133" />
  - Finally I prevented the problem to happen in the future with adding a simple line to my original script for the `$master`
  - <img width="785" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 16 31 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78a9ddef-e4f5-4dfd-988e-c811a3feac70" />
- **Connection test #2**
  - <img width="596" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 10 05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69e14073-7849-4189-97a7-49154650bffa" />
  - This time around it was a success and we had a working master-slave architecture in our 3 machine virtutal network.

**Commanding the slaves**
- Let's still make sure everything works properly by running a few commands on our master!
- `$ sudo salt '*' cmd. run 'hostname -I` to return hostnames of slaves
  - <img width="714" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 11 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef7e6d8f-7c15-47b4-89b0-55ae546c5876" />
  - The slaves were obidient and told us their IP addreses. 
- `$ sudo salt '*' state.single file.managed '/tmp/directory1'` to create a file on the slaves.
  - <img width="984" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 15 28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c03a974-e3cd-47ca-ade0-cd57df7199a2" />
  - <img width="857" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 15 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3103e58-9f63-408d-8eb3-f6f4d7bcb568" />
- Finally we wanted to check if a package was installed, and install it if not present on the system.
- `$ sudo salt '*' state.single pkg.installed tmux` to check if "tmux" is installed.
  - Indication of a successful operation and confirmation that the package was already installed from the output: "Result: True" and "Comment: already installed".
  - <img width="850" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 19 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3f849e5-0977-48c5-ad10-873868bd3bb6" />
- Everything seemed to be working as intended, the master was in charge & the machines had a connection and were operational, so I excited the master and destroyed everything behind me without leaving a trace.
  - <img width="906" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 3 20 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1d4d980-c1df-4d06-92f0-fe884a60a050" />


### Conclusion

Vagrant and Salt are highly configurable and easy-to-use tools for the creation, provisioning, and management of virtual machines. <br>

This project provided me with valuable insight and hands-on experience in using Vagrant and Salt to configure and manage virtual environments consistently and automatically. <br>

The experience deepened my understanding of infrastructure as code and highlighted the advantages of automation in modern development and system administration workflows. <br>

(Summary provided my chatGPT after telling it what I did, what I learned and what I needed the final conclusion to entail)
