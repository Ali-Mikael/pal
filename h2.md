A quick guide to setup a two computer virtual network in minutes
- Install vagrant with: `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install vagrant virtualbox`
- Saving your **vagrantfile** in a new directory: `$ mkdir thedirectory` and then inside the directory `$ nano Vagrantfile`
- Template for the config file can be found @ the link above.
- After you have the machines up and running, you can log in to them via SSH: `$ vagrant ssh <name>`
- **Perks:** very easy to destroy `$ vagrant destroy` & super simple to get machines up and running again `$ vagrant up`

**An example of applying a state:**
- Create the desired path: `$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/hello`.
- `/srv/salt` is the default root where salt looks for state files. In this case "hello" is the new state we're going to configure.
- Create the Salt State File A.K.A **.sls**: `$ sudoedit /srv/salt/hello/init.sls`.
- The .sls like all file extensions in Linux is only for the end user to differentiate more easily between files. 
- Contents of the `init.sls` file (written YAML):
- ```
  $ /tmp/infra-as-code:
      file.managed
  ```
- Now you can apply this to all minions simply with: `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply hello`.
- **Q: But what does it do?**
  - A: You basically apply the `hello` state (which you created and configured yourself), on all minions (by using the wild card = *), to check if they have the file `/tmp/infra-as-code`, and in case it isn't present, well you know, create it (an empty file named infra-as-code)!
<br>

**top.sls**
- The top.sls helps with scaling, as you can easily specify which states to run on which minions, without having to manually type everything out on the commandline.
- `/srv/salt/top.sls`
- contents of our top.sls in this example:
- ```
  base:
    '*':
      -hello
  ````
- `base` is the default environment to use as the root.
- `'*'` means all the minions. Here you could specify which minions in particular with the minion ID.
- `-hello` tells salt to apply the hello state.  
- Now you don't have to specify which modules to run. You simply type `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply`, and it will automatically run the hello state (in this case) on all your minions at the same time.
