#### Create required states for daemons
- Easily control a huge number of daemons with a configuration management system.
- Package-file-service is the common pattern.
- **Install software, replace config file, restart daemon**

#### Steps (with salt):
- Create the .sls file for the daemon. 
- Include in the file:
  - `pkg.installed` - the daemon we want
  - `file.managed` - the configurations we're applying to the config file for the daemon
  - `service.running` - make sure daemon is up and running
    - **bonus** - include `- watch: ` with the `service.running` so that salt will restart the service everytime there is a configuration change!
    - This is all about automation after all...
- Once everything is configured in the .sls file on the master. `/srv/salt/<module>/init.sls`. (`<module>` here is  daemon we're configuring, for example SSH, Apache2, UFW etc...)
- We can go ahead use Salt to apply the state our slaves with `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply <module>`. Simple as that! üôè 
- If you configured the `- watch: ` parameter in you state file with the `service.running`, then every time you make a change to the config file, it should automatically be applied to all your slave without manual intervention.
- I say "should", because we all know computers don't always compute the way we would like them to compute.
  - **Always make sure and never trust blindly!**
