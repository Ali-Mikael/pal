# Control Daemons with Salt (summary) - X
> Reference: <https://terokarvinen.com/2018/04/03/pkg-file-service-control-daemons-with-salt-change-ssh-server-port/?fromSearch=karvinen%20salt%20ssh>

#### Create required states for daemons
- Easily control a huge number of daemons with a configuration management system.
- Package -> file -> service is the common pattern.
- **Install software, replace config file, restart daemon**

#### Steps (with salt):
- Create the .sls file. 
- Include in the file:
  - `pkg.installed` - the daemon we want
  - `file.managed` - the configurations we're applying on the daemon
  - `service.running` - make sure daemon is up and running
    - **bonus** - include `- watch: ` with the `service.running` so that salt will restart the service everytime there is a configuration change!
    - This is all about automation after all...
- Once everything is configured in the .sls file on the master. `/srv/salt/<module>/init.sls`. (`<module>` point to the daemon we're configuring, for example SSH, Apache2, UFW etc...)
- We can go ahead use Salt to apply the state our slaves with `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply <module>`. Simple as that! 🙏 
- If you configured the `- watch: ` parameter in you state file with the `service.running`, then every time you make a change to the config file, it should automatically be applied to all your slave without manual intervention.
- I say "should", because we all know computers don't always compute the way we would like them to compute.
  - **Always make sure and never trust blindly!**

I used Vagrant to set up 3 virtual machines (1 salt-master & 2 salt-minions).
- Accepting the keys on my master and then doing a quick connection test
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 15 12 51](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b85514-c2ca-4a18-80b7-655ea7d6b27b)

### Manual Minion01 
- Apache was not yet present on the system.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 15 18 00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6eb7553-9778-48c5-aaf9-a3ff3dd6234c)
- Installing apache manually & locally on the minion:
- `$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` and then installing the pkg with `$ sudo apt install apache2`
- Once apache was installed, I located the `index.html` file which is stored under the `/var/www/html/` directory path and edited the default site.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 15 37 16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c93bb2-1865-4eb0-bc2d-3ff832cae6e6)
- Once the changes were made, I saved the file and typed my minions IP-address in my browser to see the changes.
  - <img width="1427" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 15 37 59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f3180fa-f21f-4c2e-ae66-88e2f5584bf6" />

### Automated Minion02 
- Making sure the minion02 doesn't have apache installed already
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 15 55 01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3873bfe-92ab-4581-b563-f6519b937a66)
- On the salt-master, created the `/srv/salt` + the apache module + moved into it + created the state file with the command:
  - `$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/apache && cd /srv/salt/apache && sudo touch init.sls`
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 16 14 16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb83e96-83cc-40c0-8f91-922900c1e9be)

**The state file:**
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 16 52 20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cbe43da-bf0a-4bbb-946a-44cd5e8e4a29)
  - `pkg.installed` - installing apache if not already installed
  - `service.running` - making sure that apache is active & running correctly. (by using `require` we're basically giving salt prerequisites for running this state, this is used for a robust and clear configuration)
  - `file.managed` - the website we're providing. `source` tells salt where to find the file we want to use.

Created `/files/sites/` under our apache module, where we can then store our html page. This is the directory path for the above mentioned `source`. 
    - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 16 41 54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6f1f466-077a-4135-ac0a-86b9b28aba78)

Now we can apply our state `$ sudo salt '*' state.apply apache` and let Salt do the magic.

  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 16 54 12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea938fc9-b023-4459-b4a8-613ce281efae)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 16 54 35](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae2b634d-9803-46b7-ab61-e214e6a4568d)

### SUMMARY:
- ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 16 55 10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5b073c7-8b40-48dc-95b4-d46e9b78201b)
    - `pkg.installed` - 1 succeeded & 1 changed - apache was installed.
    - `service.running` - 1 succeeded no change - apache was already in desired state meaning it was already running.
    - `file.managed` - 1 succeeded & 1 changed - the default `index.html` file was updated.
- Typing in `minion02`'s IP-address (192.168.88.102) in the browser to access the website
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 17 01 54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96bf310-c4c8-420a-a5d9-e4d92c943320)


### What this means for my other minion?
I typed in `minion01`'s IP-address in the browser and it gave me the same page. <br> 

`Minion01` had `3 succeeded (changed=1)`, meaning that the state file was idempotent. <br>


We previously configured apache2 on the minion01, so only the `index.html` was updated on it `(changed=1).`
> Everything seemed to work as intended, so no further comment here.

# SSH - B

For this exercise I created a master-minion, 2 VM infrastructure using Vagrant.
Once the machines were up, I logged in to my salt-master, accepted the minion key, and went straight to work. 
- `$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/ssh && cd /srv/salt/ssh && sudo touch init.sls && sudo mkdir files`
- ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 04 30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aff41d8e-a2c9-4846-be89-15cb85635b67)

The command creates the file root for salt and the `ssh` module, then moves into the directory and creates the `files` directory which is going to contain additional files for our module. 

### INIT.SLS
- ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 20 13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f8b5501-4aa4-40bb-b975-64dba5b24504)


### Creating the source for the *sshd_config* file
- I used the default configuration file, uncommented a few settings and added the ports `222` and `2222` for our ssh-server to listen to.
- `$ sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /srv/salt/ssh/files/sshd_config` copies the default file to our module.
- Here's what the beginning of the file looks like after modifications:
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 32 13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d84b031-5ec0-4e36-95f4-125ce0d0ef51)


### `state.apply`
- `$ sudo salt minion state.apply ssh`

**Picture 1:** The openssh-server was already installed (succeeded 1)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 38 25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7340df-cd3d-48d5-8026-f6cd1c05d0e8) <br>

**Picture 2:** The configuration file was updated with our latest configurations (succeeded 1, changed=1)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 38 55](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0234b139-7fe0-4870-80a1-d1bd7550314b) <br>
  
**Picture 3:** The configurations were applied, and the service was restarted, now being enabled and running (succeeded 1, changed=1)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 39 27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b6cedc-1c59-4a21-bf87-21a133c9079b) <br>


**Picture 4** (quick math): Confirmation of what I just said.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 39 42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f7bb0a0-b6ad-4d2b-a663-48d576e7ab8f) <br>
  


### But did it work?
Trying out the connection on `port 222` by scanning it using the netcat tool. <br>

`$ nc -vz 192.168.88.101 222`
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 47 41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f182f36a-1666-4a86-bb7f-816f1c3618e5)

To my amazement it did not work... So I tried to do the same on the default port just to be sure that the tool I was using was working as intended. 
  -  ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 47 52](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/812e4c82-48ed-4148-8605-be99ab5a1720)

### Troubleshooting
Apparently the problem was not in the tool I was using. I instantly navigated to my minion for some troubleshooting 
- --> `$ exit`
- --> `$ vagrant ssh minion`
- --> `$ less /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 54 34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f4158b2-6c03-44e5-b34e-d565a3cd9cf6)

The sshd configuration file had updated correctly, so the issue was not there. <br> 
I then checked the logs for any indication what might be the cause of this.
- `$ journalctl -u ssh` 
- ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 13 03 04](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fcfc57e-bcf2-4b10-9999-deb59f7bb4a5)

I noticed that when the service restarted, it didn't include the other ports correctly. <br>

So I went ahead and restarted the service manually with `$ sudo systemctl restart ssh` <br>
This still didn't help, so I used the ol' reliable `$ sudo reboot now` which totally took care of all my problems 😂
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 12 58 37](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b3338cb-32c4-4cf5-b2d9-62077e2de489)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 13 00 25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7b7226f-77f3-4dd2-8c4e-8ecd9c068e73)


I'm sad to say I still don't know the root cause to why it wasn't applying the settings correctly, but I also didn't have a whole lot of time to dig deeper at this point in time, so i'm happy I got it fixed relatively easy. I'm going to have to dvelve into this at a later time god willing! <br>

Thank you for reading, and remember: when in doubt, sudo reboot it out! 🙏 <br> 
(don't quote me on this) 


# Bonus
Installing nginx and setting up a virtualhost! <br> 
The nginx module state tree:
```
nginx
├── files
│   ├── default
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── nginx.conf
│   └── webserv1.conf
├── init.sls
├── kill.sls
└── vhost.sls
```

The init file:
```
# /srv/salt/service/nginx/init.sls

include:
  - service.apache.kill

# Install nginx
install_nginx:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: nginx


# Enable and run
nginx_service:
  service.running:
    - name: nginx
    - enable: True
    - watch: 
      - file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - file: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    - require:
        - pkg: nginx


# Managing nginx config file
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://service/nginx/files/nginx.conf
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 640


# Managing the index file
/var/www/html/index.html:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://service/nginx/files/index.html
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 644


# Managing the default file
default_available:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    - source: salt://service/nginx/files/default
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 640 


/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default:
  file.symlink:
    - target: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    - require:
      - file: default_available
```
Then we have a separate virtualhost configuration in the nginx module called `vhost.sls`: 
```
# /srv/salt/service/nginx/vhost.sls

include:
  - service.nginx


# Manage the file vhost config file in /nginx/sites-available/
/etc/nginx/sites-available/webserv1:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://service/nginx/files/webserv1.conf
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 644
    - require:
      - pkg: nginx


# Symlink from -available to -enabled 
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/webserv1:
  file.symlink:
    - target: /etc/nginx/sites-available/webserv1
    - force: True
    - require:
      - file: /etc/nginx/sites-available/webserv1


# Manage document roots
webserv1_document_root:
  file.directory:
    - name: /var/www/webserv1/html
    - user: vagrant
    - group: vagrant
    - mode: 755
    - makedirs: True


# Manage the index.html page
/var/www/webserv1/html/index.html:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://service/nginx/files/index.html
    - user: vagrant
    - group: vagrant
    - mode: 644
    - require: 
      - file: webserv1_document_root


# Restart nginx after applying vhost config
nginx:
  service.running:
    - reload: True
    - watch:
      - file: /etc/nginx/sites-available/webserv1
```


```
$ sudo salt 'web-serv' state.apply service.nginx.vhost
```
The command above will execute the init.sls state as well as set up the virtual host, due to the `include` clause in the `vhost.sls` file

```
Because of the `include` cause in the vhost file, we don't have to run these separately, we can just run vhost straight up and get desired results. <br> 

Because I already configured the `/etc/hosts` file on my host computer ( by appending `192.168.88.102 nginxwebserv1.com www.nginxwebserv1.com`), we can ensure this is working, by typing `nginxwebserv1` into our browser <br> 
![Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 12 12 39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc5215be-636e-46c7-8c41-5346ef78f0b7) <br> 

But can we modify the site from our home directory? <br> 
```
vagrant@web-serv:~$ pwd
/home/vagrant
vagrant@web-serv:~$ mkdir sites && cd sites && touch hello.html
vagrant@web-serv:~/sites$ nano hello.html
```
```
vagrant@web-serv:/var/www/webserv1/html$ ln -s /home/vagrant/sites/hello.html ./hello.html
vagrant@web-serv:/var/www/webserv1/html$ ls
hello.html  index.html
```
```
chmod o+x /home/vagrant
chmod o+x /home/vagrant/sites
```
Now we can type in `http://nginxwebserv1.com/hello.html` into the web browser <br> 
![Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 12 32 00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7076c5a7-ff2b-47a9-9092-0015d70e3474) <br> 
<br> 
No sudo was needed, we could create a site in our home directory as a normal user and then make it visible.
