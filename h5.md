# Project
A basic virtual private lab that you can easily set up and modify for your own purposes. 
<br>

### Prerequisites: 
A computer, Vagrant & VirtualBox.
<br> 

# - Breaking it down -
Step 1: Creating a git repository `VirtualPrivateLab` on my computer. <br> 

### Defining the structure
Step 2: Created a vagrantfile and the salt directory

#### Vagrantfile:
  - Creates 1 `salt-master` & 3x `salt-minion`
  - The minions are created inside a for loop for scalability (remember to check /srv/salt/top.sls when toying with the minions)
  - Configures private networking
  - Master IP-address is network prefix + `100`
  - Minions will get the address prefix + `10x` (x = minion number. (1, 2, 3...))
  - As this is a lab setup and not production, the master will auto-accept all minion keys

#### The salt structure:

This will be used as the base for salt in /srv/salt on the master machine
